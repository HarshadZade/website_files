A robot for moving objects. It is differential drive based Bluetooth controlled robot. A 3 DoF servo controlled arm is made with a gripper end effector for pick and place mechanism. 2 Arduinos are used for controlling arm and motion independently. A single channel relay is used for optimizing power consumption by switching off the arm when not in use.
