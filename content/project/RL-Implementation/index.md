### Abstract
To broaden my perspective on Machine Learning, I took up Reinforcement Learning courses by David Silver, Stanford CS234. To understand the nuances in the field, I implemented basic algorithms. The inspiration for the same was also drawn through [a project](https://khush3.github.io/publication/stair_climbing/) where the idea of using Imitation Learning to overcome several limitations, struck me.
### Implementated: 

- [x] DQN
- [x] Vanilla Policy Gradient
- [x] PPO
- [ ] DDPG

### Results
#### Value and Policy Iteration
