abstract = "Helper robots are widely used in various situations, for ex-ample at airports and railway stations. This paper presents a pipelineto multiplex the tracking and detection of a person in dynamic envi-ronments using a stereo camera in real-time. Recent developments inobject detection using ConvNets have led to robust person detection.These deep convolutional neural networks generally fail to run with highframes rates on devices with less computing power. Trackers are alsoused to retain the identity of the target person as well as imposefewerconstraints on hardware. A concept of multiplexed detection and track-ing is used which makes the pipeline faster by many folds. TurtleBot-2is used for prototyping the robot and tuning of the motion controller.Robot Operating System (ROS) is used to set up communication be-tween various nodes of the pipeline. The results found were comparableto current state-of-the-art person followers and can be readily usedinday to day life."
