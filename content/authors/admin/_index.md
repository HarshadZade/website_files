My interest lies in Machine Learning and Electronics, particularly in its application to Robotics. I look forward to developing Robotic-Systems that tightly couple Cognition and Electronics. I have worked on Machine Learning for a while now, and have developed a keen interest in Reinforcement Learning. 

In my sophomore year, I started to work under [Dr. Shital Chiddarwar](http://mec.vnit.ac.in/people/sschiddarwar/) in [IvLabs](http://www.ivlabs.in/) and took various challenges that involved the application of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. 

I'm always up to something! [Here's](https://khush3.github.io/project/experience-transfer/) what's keeping me occupied these days.

Besides research, I enjoy music and spending time in nature.
