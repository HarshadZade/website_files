I am interested in working at the intersection of machine learning and robotics. 

Presently, I am working at [Prof Howie Choset\'s](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/) [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/) on efficient distributed learning. 

During my undergraduate studies, I spent time working at [Dr. Shital Chiddarwar\'s](http://mec.vnit.ac.in/people/sschiddarwar/) [IvLabs](http://www.ivlabs.in/) addressing challenges in the application of deep learning and reinforcement learning to robotics. 

I spent the summer of 2020 working in [Dr. David Held\'s](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/david-held/) [R-PAD Lab](https://r-pad.github.io/) at Carnegie Mellon University as a part of the Robotics Institute Summer Scholar's Program remotely. 

Besides research, I enjoy listening to music, playing guitar, and spending time in nature.
